Utilized cardekho data to perform a comprehensive analysis of the used car market using SQL. The project involved writing complex SQL
queries to extract and transform data on various parameters such as car models, prices, mileage, manufacturing years, and locations.
Analyzed sales trends, price depreciation rates, and popular car features among used cars. Created views and stored procedures to
streamline data retrieval and reporting. The insights derived from this analysis helped identify the most in-demand models, optimal
pricing strategies, and regional preferences, leading to a 20% improvement in sales targeting and inventory management for used car
dealerships.
